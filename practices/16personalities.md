**TL;DR**

16 personalities is a short personality test that helps with communication within the team and uncovers general strong points and weaknesses of every team member.

## What Is 16 Personalities

16personalities is a personality test analyzing the personal traits of the test-taker and putting those on a scale from 0 to 100. The corner values represent the very opposite sides of the spectrum for the given trait. The test distinguishes 5 different traits, namely:
- Mind - Introverted vs. Extroverted
- Energy - Observant vs. Intuitive
- Nature - Thinking vs. Feeling
- Tactics - Judging vs. Prospecting
- Identity - Assertive vs. Turbulent

The result of the test is 5 (4+1) (e.g. ENFP-T, also known as a [turbulent campaigner](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality) letters that identify one of 16 personalities, of which the site provides detailed information regarding the professional and personal relationships, strength suits, weaknesses and potential directions for further personal development.

## Problems It Solves for Teams

16personalities is a good choice for already existing teams to help team members work more effectively with each other and how to maximize the potential each team member possesses. Contrary to that, new teams being built can benefit from knowing the strong suits and weaknesses of team members which can lead to building more effective teams with good relationships.

## Common Pitfalls You Might Encounter

For every benefit, there often is a disadvantage and 16personalities is no different. It is important to keep in mind that it is still a generalization and everyone is unique. Although two people can be the same type, they can also be very different given the spectrum they operate in. Lastly, the test builds heavily on traits, not skills, and thus we recommend to combine it with other test, such as Gallup, that analyze soft skills and mindset in more depth.
