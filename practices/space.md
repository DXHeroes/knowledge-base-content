# What is SPACE?
Nothing to do with Elon or NASA. **SPACE** is a framework that helps measure **developer productivity** â€” but not in the outdated way of just counting commits or tracking hours worked.
Instead, **SPACE** stands for:
**Satisfaction** â€“ Are developers happy and engaged?
**Performance** â€“ Is their work high-quality and impactful?
**Activity** â€“ Are they actively contributing in meaningful ways?
**Communication & Collaboration** â€“ Are they working well with the team?
**Efficiency** â€“ Can they do their job without unnecessary blockers?
The key idea? **Thereâ€™s no single metric that defines developer productivity. ** You need to **look at multiple factors together** â€” because just counting commits tells you nothing about code quality, teamwork, or developer happiness.

## Why Use SPACE?
SPACE helps **teams, managers, and companies** track productivity without falling into the trap of oversimplified metrics. Instead of just measuring output, it looks at the **bigger picture** â€” how work is done, how effective it is, and how sustainable it is.
Using SPACE can help:
Identify **burnout risks** before they become a problem.
Improve **team collaboration** and communication.
Measure **real productivity**, not just code churn.
Find **bottlenecks** in workflows that slow developers down.
Balance **quality and speed** without overloading developers.
If your goal is to **build a high-performing and happy team**, SPACE gives you a **realistic** way to measure progress.
## Problems SPACE Can Help Solve
**Burnout & dissatisfaction** â€“ If developers are unhappy, theyâ€™ll be less engaged and productive. SPACE tracks satisfaction to spot issues early.
**Lack of visibility into real contributions** â€“ A developer who writes fewer commits but mentors others and improves code quality is still highly valuable. SPACE considers all contributions.
**Frequent blockers and inefficiencies** â€“ Long approval processes, outdated tools, and poor documentation slow developers down. SPACE highlights workflow issues.
**Poor communication and collaboration** â€“ Miscommunication leads to delays and frustration. SPACE ensures that **knowledge-sharing and teamwork** are part of productivity.

## How to Implement SPACE
Integrating SPACE into your workflow means looking beyond **just the numbers** â€” it requires **culture, tools, and process changes**.
**Measure What Matters** â€“ Track all five SPACE metrics instead of focusing on just activity (like commit count).
**Use the Right Tools** â€“ Platforms like GitHub, Jira, LinearB, and internal surveys help collect meaningful data.
**Foster a Supportive Culture** â€“ Encourage open communication, mentorship, and collaborationâ€”not just speed.
**Automate & Streamline** â€“ Reduce manual blockers, improve documentation, and ensure developers can work smoothly.
**Review & Iterate** â€“ Regularly analyze SPACE data, discuss findings with the team, and adjust processes as needed.

## Common Pitfalls of %{SPACE}
**Focusing too much on one metric** â€“ Looking at just **activity** (like commits) gives a **false sense** of productivity. Balance all SPACE dimensions.
**Neglecting team dynamics** â€“ Productivity isnâ€™t just about individualsâ€”itâ€™s about how the team **works together**.
**Measuring without acting** â€“ Data is useless if you donâ€™t **use it to improve workflows, tools, and processes. **
**Treating SPACE as a performance review tool** â€“ SPACE is **not about ranking developers. ** Itâ€™s about **improving teams and work environments**.

## Summary
Unlike [DORA](/practices/dora), which focuses on deployment and operational performance, **SPACE** takes a **big-picture** look at developer productivity. It helps teams understand not just **how much work is getting done, but also how well and at what cost** â€” giving a **fuller picture of both performance and developer happiness. **
At **DX Heroes**, we assess these metrics as part of our **DX Audit** to help teams improve their workflow and make developers happier. **Want to level up your dev team? ** Hit us up at **hello@dxheroes.io** ðŸš€
