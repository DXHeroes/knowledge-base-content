# Good Developer Experience

## What Is a Good Developer Experience

The Developer Experience (DX) describes the experience developers have while using or working on your product. It is a package of positive and also negative feelings. In many companies, more common than dealing with DX is trying to make a User Experience (UX) as good as possible. This approach is unfortunate - developers are users too! They use your product, frameworks, tools, etc. and they have some experience from using it. It is up to you to decide if this experience is going to be a good one or a bad one. But remember, their satisfaction and happiness are crucial for the success of your project. Happy developers are necessary for creating exceptional software in the long term. By having a positive developer experience, you can ensure that your developers are happy and satisfied and are less likely to leave your team.

We define a great DX by these four factors:

1.  Fitting architecture
		- Find a compromise between a simpler and a more complex architecture. Simple means more pain later, complex brings more pain now. Consider the size of your project and your team. A good architecture is difficult to break, has short feedback loops and it has a great introspection.

2.  Great tools
		- Automate as much as possible. Repetitive tasks are exhausting. Automation lets your team understand the configurations.

3.  Processes to back that all up
		- Processes work as automated checklists. You have consistent steps that need to be done each time. It helps you with the team discipline. Use processes for QA, deployment, feedback, and for onboarding if your company is big enough.

4.  Nontoxic team culture
		- Define the purpose of your company: making money should not be the only goal. Culture itself is the most important brainware (a software that runs in the brain) you can install within your company and the team - every decision the developers take will be filtered through the installed brainware. If they do not agree with the brainware, they ignore it.

## Why You Might Want the Good Developer Experience

The teams with good DX are high productive teams and they have these traits:

-   Sense of impact
		They understand that they are not just making money. They know that their work matters, they are improving someone else’s life.

-   Great sense of ownership and responsibilities
		They are responsible for the success. Every team member should have a responsibility for the company’s success.

-   Common goal with the team and the company, between divisions etc.

-   Friendliness and honesty
		We call it “hey bro” culture. We emphasise sincerity with great respect.

-   Allows for failure
		Developers should be brave and take risks. But the risks should always be calculated and the developers have to be aware of how much of a boom every action can cause.

Traits of culture with bad DX:

-   Finger pointing
		For example, team members blame each other for poor work. This is a very toxic thing but it happens a lot.

-   Big penalty for a failure
		For example, when your boss says that if you do not meet the deadline, you can be fired

-   Constant crunch time, constant overloading of the teams

-   Hostility and uncertainty
		Unhealthy competitiveness between teams (for example, this guy was promoted because he did a better job than me)

-   Diluted responsibility
In big companies, nobody is responsible for anything. It takes balls to say: “sorry guys, I screwed up”. It is crucial to be able to take the responsibility.

## How to Implement the Good Developer Experience

There is a famous "Scope Triangle" created in the mid 1980s by Dr. Martin Barnes. It shows the relationship between the three primary forces in a project:

This triangle means that if you want to increase the time, you have to increase money or quality.
We disagree - that is not how it works in reality. You have to insert an emotional cost to the triangle:

If your developer has to stay late to finish a task, it is not only the time they have to invest. Another part of this investment is an emotional cost. Having a great DX helps you having this emotional cost under control. Keep the emotional cost low to make your developers happy.

## Common Pitfalls of the Good Developer Experience

-   Giving too much information to developers too soon.
-   Giving too little information to developers when they need more.
-   Overusing processes can result into:
		-   the mentality of “one size fits all”
		-   the over-engineering tendencies
		-   thinking that agile = an excuse to throw more work at the developers
