# Tips to know if you are a coder(or want to become one)

## Who is the coder?

1. You don’t need a hi-tech computer to start coding

At the start of the journey, often beginners put starting off learning till they have a “good enough computer”. But in actuality, it is an excuse to avoid dragging yourself to the computer/laptop and start coding.

2. Googling is the most important skill

We live in a world of information abundance.Also people are more interested in hiring people who can use the information constructively.

3. Version Control is a must

Version Control is probably the most important tool for a software developer. It saves, backs up your codebase, and also enables you to collaborate with other developers.

4. One Completed Project is better than 100 Incomplete Ones

As mentioned previously, people judge you based on what you’ve done, not what you plan to do. So put your best foot forward and have a few deployed projects, to ease up the process for the viewer.

5. Self-taught Programmers have the best debugging skills

Self-taught Programmers lack the opportunity of having someone help out whenever they face a problem, so after 100s of trial and error, they develop efficient ways to squash a bug.

6. You don’t need the right answer, just a less wrong one

People are so afraid of failing that they don’t even give things a shot. A failure is truly a failure, only if you don’t learn from it and keep repeating the same mistakes.

7. Tutorials fail to teach you the most important skill

The most crucial skill problem-solving, which comes only through trial and error. Tutorials give you a highly refactored final version of the code, so you miss out on seeing the skill in action.

8. Learn what NOT to learn

Learning every is simply not humanely possible. First test out the waters by trying out everything, then choose the technology that you feel the best for you.

9. Consistency

Nobody became a pro by putting in 20 hours in a day, but a lot of people did it by putting in 1 hour for 20 days. Your brain needs time to digest the information, you feed it.

10. Open Source can help you level up

Open Source is a great way to learn by building amazing Softwares and tools. But be prepared to be constantly learning as you would be required to be constantly adapting to new technologies.
