# Lock File

**TL;DR**

Why should your source repository always contain a lock file? Package managers would miss important imformation about installed packages without a lock file. It may result in installing two different modules from the same dependency definition.

## What Is a Lock File?

Many people decide to ignore the lock files and they do not commit it to Git. What is a lock file and why should your repository contain one?

A lock file contains important information about installed packages and it should always be committed into your [Package Manager](/practices/package-management) source repositories. Not committing the lock file to your source control results in installing two different modules from the same dependency definition.

**A lock file:**

- Is generated automatically for any operation
- Describes the dependency tree and its changes, so the coworkers are guaranteed to install exactly the same dependencies
- Lets you "travel back in time" and check any former dependency tree
- Allows your Package Manager to skip repeated metadata resolutions for previously-installed packages and, therefore, makes the installation much faster

## Why You Might Want the Lock File

The package managers need more than just the configuration information - they need the exact version of each dependency installed. Remember to always commit your lock files to your source repositories!

- The lock file guarantees a consistent install across machines.
- Your Package Manager will use the lock file to resolve and install modules.
- The lock file locks the specific version, location, and integrity hash for every package.
- The lock file ensures that the install creates the same version every time, no matter what device.

## How to Implement the Lock File

We cannot emphasize it more - **always commit the lock file to your source repository!** And then let it do its magic.

## Common Pitfalls of the Lock File

- The lock file is being ignored
- The lock file is not committed in the source repository
- The lock file is rewritten by hand and it can lose its functions
