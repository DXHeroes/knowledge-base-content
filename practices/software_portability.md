# Software Portability

## TL;DR

Portability in high-level computer programming is the usability of the same software in different environments.

## What Is Software Portability?

Software portability is the possibility to use the same software in different environments. It applies to the software that is available for two or more different platforms or can be recompiled for them. 

## Why Should We Port?

- There are many hardware and software platforms; it is not only the Windows world.
- Users who move to different environments want familiar software.
- We want easier migration to new system versions and to totally new environments.
- Developers want to spend more time on new development and less on redevelopment.
- More users for the same product means lower software costs.

## Portability Kinds

### Application Portability

Portable applications can be converted from one computer environment to another one. 
With regards to Windows apps, such programs would not use the Registry. In a totally portable application, all related files would be stored in a single folder so it can be copied with one command. Such a folder has many sub-folders, and they are copied in the same transaction. 
[Walled gardens](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/walled-garden) prevent data from being easily transferred. 

###  Source Code Portability

It is possible to compile software for different operating systems and processors provided that it is written in a programming language that supports compilation for the respective platforms. 
As users usually don't have access to the source code and they are not skilled enough to do it, it's a task for developers.

### Data Portability 

Portable data can be moved from one database or repository to another. It implies that the data are in electronic files that are readily accessible rather than only visually on a screen. Otherwise, the data must be retyped word for word into another application and on-screen images must be captured one at a time. 

## Strategies for Portability

-   Transferring installed program files to another computer of basically the same architecture.
-   Reinstalling a program from distribution files on another computer of basically the same architecture.
-   Building executable programs for different platforms from source code; this is usually called “porting”. 

## Cross-platform Software 

This software is implemented on multiple platforms. There are two types of cross-platform software:
- the first one requires individual building or compilation for each platform
- the second one can be directly run on any platform.

Cross-platform applications can run e.g. on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Software Portability Pitfalls

**Porting vs. Redevelopment**

Should the existing program be ported, or should an equivalent program be redeveloped? Such questions are not always easy to answer. 

**Degree of Portability** 

What degree of portability is desired for the various environments? Again, it can be difficult to deal with this and similar questions. 

**Cost vs. Benefits**

It can be very difficult to determine the cost vs. benefits ratio. So, it is possible that the costs exceed the benefits.
