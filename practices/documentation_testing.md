# Documentation Testing

**TL;DR** Documentation testing is a process of improving your existing documentation through the Passive Feedback Gathering and Active Testing. Understanding how to work with feedback is crucial for building good documentation and positive developer experience.

## What is Documentation Testing?

As said above, documentation testing is a few processes of continuous feedback gathering and documentation improvements based on feedback. You can imagine it as active listening to your developers. Similarly, as you use testing for your code, you should be testing your docs to provide clear and precise information that contributes to positive developer experience.

Docs are a developer’s first impression of your product, yet they are often overlooked. Improving your Docs directly translate into improving first impressions.

For clarity's sake, you can split Documentation testing into Active Testing and Passive Feedback Gathering. 

### Passive Feedback Gathering
Under Passive Feedback Gathering, you can imagine two categories. One is ways to give voice to your developers through Feedbacks, ratings, or more advanced methods. The second part of Passive Feedback Gathering is data mining tools that help you understand developer behavior. 

Information gathered via Passive Feedback Gathering helps you make data driven decisions that benefit your readers.

### Active Testing
Active Testing is testing of your documentation. It is similar to UX testing or Code testing. Unlike the other types of testing, Documentation testing is mainly manual testing. Through manual testing, you can build rapport and empathy with your readers.

## Why You Might Want Documentation Testing?
Through testing your documentation you understand the first impression of your product. Moreover, you gain insight into the decision funnel and you start to understand who is using your product and why. Documentation testing can help you find weak points in your documentation.

It is a series of good practices and even small teams without tech writers can improve their developer experience by adopting documentation testing.  

## Problems Documentation Testing Helps to Solve

* Lack of understanding around your product
* Lack of developers using your product
* Damaged information flow
* Unclear instructions
* Lack of empathy towards developers

## How to Implement Documentation Testing?
There are many ways of implementing Documentation Testing. You can start with: 
### Implementing Passive Feedback Gathering
Consider the following Passive Feedback Gathering methods:
#### Ratings on Existing Docs
Start by adding a way to rate your existing documentation. Consider adding questions like: “Is this page helpful to you?” Or “Did this guide benefit you?”. Even a simple star rating can add crucial data for your decisions.
> Allowing ratings on your Docs helps to build rapport with your readers. Look at which pages are well-received and which need improvements.

#### On-Page Behaviour
The behavior on-page can tell you a lot about your Doc’s perception. Start using analytical software (popular options are: [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com), [GoSquared](https://www.gosquared.com/analytics/), [Clicky](https://clicky.com), [Statcounter](https://statcounter.com), or [Matomo](https://matomo.org)) to monitor your readers. 
> The time spent on each page, the bounce rate of your pages, referrals, and leaving pages can help you understand how people interact with your docs. 

#### Off-page Behaviour
Understanding who is your reader is crucial to tailor your docs around them. Software like [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) can show you why are your readers visiting your documentation.
> Tracking why people visit you is crucial to understand which issues and questions bring people to you. Knowing what brings people to you, you can tailor your docs to provide a better experience to your visitors.

#### Clicks and download tracking
Consider logging how many people download your code samples. For this logging, you can use software like [Google Tag Manager](http://tagmanager.google.com). With Google Tag Manager, you can use Custom events, for example scroll rate or download rate, to gain better insight on your Docs performance.
> Track any action that is important for you. From Sing-ups to finishing demo, this information directly makes difference in improving developer experience.

### Implementing Active Testing
Following Active Testing methods can give you insight on your Documentation DX.
#### Questionnaires
Questionnaires give your readers a way to directly give their feedback. You can gather interesting information through it. Moreover, if you reach out after the questionnaire you can improve community relationships.
> Forms and questionnaires are powerful tool if used correctly. With a good form, you can build rapport and turn this rapport into better dx.

#### In-house Testing
One of the best things you can always do is to test your documentation In-house. Read through your docs. Let your developers try the demos and gather their thoughts. Take people with different background and skillset. 5 to 6 people is enough to start improving your developer experience.
> Anyone around you can help you with in-house testing. Test if you can understand your docs. Test if your sample codes work. Test what happens if you auto-translate your docs. Be emphatic. Use my favorite definition: _Empathy is connecting with emotions, not with experience._

#### Outsourced Testing
If you don’t want to spend your resources on In-house Testing, you can try outsourcing it. Services like [Betatesting](https://betatesting.com/beta-testers), [Usertesting](https://www.usertesting.com), or [Devskiller](https://devskiller.com) can sometimes connect you with good testing developer. You can connect with developer community at places like [Dev](https://dev.to) or [DXheroes Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/developerexperiencehq/shared_invite/enQtNzU5NjUyNDk2MDM1LTRmNjM5ZTllOTc1NmU5ZWRhNGNkODU1ZmY0ZWExYWUyN2YyNzM4ZTMzNjIyNWJhNTRmNjA5ZTVhMGRmZjM4ZjY). Alternatively, you can hire freelancers through platforms like [Freelancer](http://freelancer.com), [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com), [Fivver](https://www.fiverr.com) or [Peopleperhour](https://www.peopleperhour.com). 
> You can always outsource the testings if you don’t want to use in-house testing or you want additional data. Outsourcing your testing is not as expensive as you may think, having around 5 - 6 testers is generally enough to understand the dx you provide.
