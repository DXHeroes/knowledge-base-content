# API-First Development

**TL;DR**

API First is not a destination but a journey, You are API first when you prioritize APIs and add the daily incremental effort to make sure you strengthen your commitment to doing APIs. Among the different types of web APIs, REST (Representational State Transfer) API has become the most popular due to its simplicity, scalability, and flexibility.

## What is API First Development 

***Kin Lane Postman Chief Evangelist is the author of these words*** >API first design is API first, API first code is API first. It is important to note that your business is API First and you don’t actually need to tick a checkbox in other to attain API first-led company. 

Let's take a step and explore what is API First - An API First approach posits that application programming interface (API) design and development should come before implementation.

It is a methodology for developing software that gives teams justifications for putting the API (Application Programming Interface) at the center of the procedure. This means that before working on the user interface (UI) or other application components, developers concentrate on designing, creating, and testing the API.

Remember earlier we mentioned that API First is not a destination but a journey and that there is no checklist you must follow in order to publicly refer to your company as an API First company, You'll undoubtedly notice that your software team spent a lot of time developing, testing, and ensuring that the API achieves business objectives when it comes time to adopt APIs across other products. This is because APIs come first in your company. I now advise you to consider your software development methodology and never doubt presenting your business as an API.

In an API First development approach, the API is seen as the primary interface between the application and its users. By prioritizing the API in the development process, developers can ensure that it is well-designed, scalable, and secure, which can ultimately improve the overall user experience.

API First development has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the rise of [Web API](https://developerexperience.io/articles/rest-api) and the increasing importance of APIs in software development. 


### Understanding API First to Building Products

At its core, your API is fundamentally treated as "first-class citizens," therefore how can we best express the API First philosophy while creating products? 

* To begin building a product using an API-first approach, the business manager or product manager and the API team should start by establishing the scope and objectives of the project before starting to build a product. This may involve conducting market research to identify user needs and preferences, as well as exploring potential integrations with other systems and services.

* Developers can begin designing the API after defining the project's goals. This may entail drafting a thorough specification that specifies the API's endpoints, parameters, and anticipated answers as well as any necessary security or authentication measures.

* With the API specification in place, developers can begin building the API's backend functionality, including data models, business logic, and integrations with other systems. The API can then be tested using automated tests to ensure that it meets the required performance and security standards.

* Developers can begin creating the user interface and other application components that will use the API after the API has been created and tested. Developers may guarantee that these components are well-integrated and capable of interacting with the API in a seamless manner by developing them with the API in mind.

## Why You Might Want the API First Development

When compared to other development methodologies, such as conventional monolithic development or service-oriented architecture (SOA), API-first development has a number of advantages. Among these advantages are

* **Getting early validation**: Early validation allows the team to adjust or pivot in response to any new inputs while the cost of change is still manageable. As a result, overall project costs are decreased.


* **Improved agility and flexibility**: The modular nature of API-first development allows for more agility and flexibility in the development process. Developers can make changes to the API without affecting other parts of the application, making it easier to adapt to changing business requirements


* **Faster time-to-market**: API-first development enables developers to create and improve APIs apart from other application components. This enables a quicker time-to-market because new functionality may be added to the API without requiring changes to the underlying application code.


## Problems the API First Development Helps to Solve

API-first development helps to solve several problems that are common in traditional monolithic development approaches:

* **Slow time-to-market**: Modifying or adding new features to a monolithic application can be a slow and time-consuming process, as changes to one part of the application may require changes to other parts as well.
* **Limited scalability**: Monolithic applications can be difficult to scale as they grow, as all components are tightly coupled and must be scaled together.

* **Limited flexibility**: Monolithic applications can be inflexible and difficult to modify, making it hard to adapt to changing business requirements.

## Common Pitfalls of the API First Development

Even though API-first programming has many advantages, there are certain frequent traps that programmers could run into. A few of these are:

* **Poor API design or Design Complexity**: It might be challenging to use, maintain, and update APIs that have a poor design. This may cause usability problems and prevent other teams or outside developers from using the API.

* **Over-engineering**: When building a highly flexible and modular API architecture, it's simple to get carried away, but doing so might increase complexity and development time.

* **Lack of documentation**: API documentation is essential for assisting other teams or outside developers in understanding how to utilize the API. Confusion and problems with adoption can result from a lack of documentation.

To avoid these pitfalls, it's important to prioritize API design and documentation, implement Additionally, strive to strike a balance between business value and API delivered
