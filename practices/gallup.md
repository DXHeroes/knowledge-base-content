It distinguishes 34 different themes in 4 general domains - namely Executing, Influencing, Relationship building and Strategic thinking domain for which it focuses on general inclination and expertise in themes. Respondents are given 177 pairs of statements of opposite meaning and a scale to position themselves on.

It is only up to the team leader what qualities they want to see in their future coworkers.

To put it in other words, the profile of ideal developer should be made of inner will for continuous improvement of skills, focus on teamwork and consensus within the team, getting things done and standing up for their work.

Last but not least, the test was mostly
conducted and shaped in a corporate environment where respondents provide responses different to the respondents in smaller companies or startups.
