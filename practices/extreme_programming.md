# Extreme Programming (XP)

**TL;DR**

Extreme programming is a software development methodology that promotes quality and encourages collaboration.

## What Is Extreme Programming (XP)?

XP is a software development methodology that emerged from the agile movement in the late 1990s. XP is focused on extremely short delivery cycles, typically aiming to produce a working product after just two or three weeks of effort. XP also prioritizes building features at the time when they are actually needed, rather than trying to plan everything upfront. This makes XP particularly well-suited for projects with rapidly changing requirements.

### How Does Extreme Programming Work?

There are twelve core practices in extreme programming:

 - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
 - Continuous integration
 - Test-driven development
 - Pair programming
 - Collective ownership
 - Progressive elaboration
 - Sustainable pace
 - Technical debt management
 - Refactoring
 - Simplicity
 - Feedback-driven development

XP teams typically work in short cycles, called "sprints". At the beginning of each sprint, the team agrees on a set of features that they will try to complete during the sprint. The team then works together to design, code, test, and deploy those features. At the end of the sprint, they demo their work to stakeholders and get feedback from them. This process repeats itself over and over again until the project is finished.

## Why You Might Want Extreme Programming

Extreme programming is focused on delivering high-quality software quickly. This makes extreme programming an appropriate choice for projects with rapidly changing requirements, though it can be used in any type of environment where you need to build quality software as quickly as possible.

XP prioritizes building features at the time when they are actually needed rather than trying to plan everything upfront. This approach also helps teams avoid wasting their energy working on unnecessary features that might not ultimately get used by users or may change significantly over time anyway. Instead, XP teams work closely together and continuously integrate all changes into a shared codebase so that everyone has access to the latest version of the project's source code at all times. The team updates this "single source" frequently during each sprint, which makes extreme programming well-suited for projects where the requirements are still being determined or may change frequently.

## Problems X Helps to Solve

One of the major problems extreme programming helps to solve is how to build software quickly and effectively. For some companies, building a complete project can take years or even decades as they struggle with constantly-changing requirements from their clients. In extreme programming, this problem also gets resolved by using short development cycles where all stakeholders work closely together on a daily basis in order to ensure that each sprint delivers high-quality features that actually meet user needs. Since extreme programmers are constantly integrating new changes into a single codebase, it's easy for them to detect any bugs or other issues that might crop up during ongoing development efforts so those can be fixed immediately rather than waiting until later stages of the process when they're harder (and more expensive) to resolve.

## How to Implement Extreme Programming

In order to use extreme programming effectively, you need to have a team that's willing to buy into the philosophy and is also able to work closely together. The team should be composed of people with diverse skillsets who can help contribute in all aspects of software development. It's also important that everyone on the team is comfortable working in an agile environment where requirements may change frequently and they must be prepared to adapt their plans accordingly.

If your company isn't currently using extreme programming, it might be worthwhile to investigate how you could start incorporating some of its core practices into your existing software development process. There are many resources available online (including this one) that can help get you started.

## Common Pitfalls of Extreme Programming

One potential pitfall of extreme programming is that it can be difficult to maintain a sustainable pace when you're working on short development cycles. This is especially true if your team is new to XP or isn't used to working in an environment where changes are constantly happening. Teams that work in this type of environment need to be very communicative and need to ensure that everyone is always up-to-date on the latest changes so no one falls too far behind.

Another common pitfall of extreme programming is failing to properly manage technical debt. In extreme programming, teams often take on more technical debt than they would in other methodologies because they're frequently making rapid changes to their codebase. If teams don't have a plan for how to deal with this debt, extreme programming can have a significant impact on the software's quality over time.
