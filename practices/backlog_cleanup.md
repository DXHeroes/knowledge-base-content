# Backlog Cleanup

**TL;DR**

A well-managed backlog results in a better overview of your important open issues and features, faster planning, and a cleaner scope. Periodically remove obsolete items from the backlog that have been created throughout the project lifecycle.

## What Is Backlog Cleanup  

Backlog Cleanup describes the process of managing issues in your product backlog. Your backlog may be full of old feature ideas.
After some strategy meetings in the last months/quarters, your feature ideas may be out of scope, since the product strategy has shifted in a different direction.

## Why You Might Want Backlog Cleanup

Both the prioritiation and the size of a product backlog is key. Your team will most probably work on the top items in the list. 
When product backlogs grow, it will be harder to see the relation between items. Backlog cleanup will help you to keep the overview.

## Problems Backlog Cleanup Helps to Solve

- Getting a better overview of important tasks
- Not loosing time due to a long and confusing backlog

## How to Implement Backlog Cleanup

- **Go through the product backlog on a regular basis:** For example, once a week or month: This process is called Grooming. The frequency depends on your the number of new cards and how often strategy changes happen.
- **Find a good upper limit:** Find a good number of backlog items that you can deal with. You can store your ideas separately and review them after your next strategy meeting. 
- **Group related items:** To find relations between items, you can try to group them in Epics. Epics are your big topics that contain smaller pieces that are required to reach a goal or ship a bigger feature.
- **Prioritize your backlog and make the top items ready to work on:** In each sprint, your team will work on the items at the top of your backlog. They will need to know what to do.

## Common Pitfalls

- You will see items that are not ready to work on. Remove these items and take them to your next Grooming meeting (again).
- There may be ideas that are not in line with the current product strategy. Lower their priority or remove them from your backlog.
