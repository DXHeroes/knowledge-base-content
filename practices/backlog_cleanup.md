# Backlog Cleanup

**TL;DR**

Backlog Cleanup is important to keep a well-managed backlog. An ordered and short list of tasks, issues, and ideas results in a better overview of what's important, faster planning, and a cleaner scope. Periodically remove obsolete items from the backlog that have been created throughout the project lifecycle.

## What Is Backlog Cleanup  

Backlog Cleanup describes the process of managing tasks, issues, and ideas in your product backlog. You can reorder, rewrite, and delete backlog items.

## Why You Might Want Backlog Cleanup

Typically, companies have a project board, such as Trello, Jira, or GitHub projects. The boards contain columns for the different stages and the inbox or backlog column contains many different items. After some strategy meetings in the past months, some of the items in your backlog may be out of scope, since the product strategy or your team's priorities have shifted in a different direction.

Both the prioritiation and the size of a product backlog is key. When backlogs grow, it will be harder to see the relationship between items. Backlog cleanup will help you to keep track. And, your team will start working on the first items in the list. You want these top prioritzed items to be ready to work on.

## Problems Backlog Cleanup Helps to Solve

- **Spending too much time to find information:** Different parties, such as your colleages, your customers, and your team may be able to create backlog items. Link between related items. Make sure you have only one item per topic.
- **Not knowing the efforts/priorities:** Move your top priority items to the top of your backlog. It's important to know the effort of an item for a proper sprint planning.
- **Unclear items titles and descriptions:** Use a template and follow certain rules or quality standards.
- **No alignment with the product strategy:** Ensure that all items in your backlog are still in line with the product strategy.

## How to Implement Backlog Cleanup

- **Prioritize your backlog:** The higher the items in the list, the more important they are.
- **Make enough items ready to work on:** In each sprint, your team works on the items at the top of your backlog. The team needs to know what to do.
- **Go through the product backlog on a regular basis:** For example, once a week or month in a Grooming or Product refinement meeting. The frequency depends on your the number of new cards and how often strategy changes happen.
- **Group related items:** To find relations between items, you add links to other issues or try to group bigger topics into Epics. Epics are your big topics that contain smaller pieces that are required to reach a goal or ship a bigger feature.
- **Find a good upper limit for the number of items:** An upper limit of cards may be optional depending on your project. But you can, for example, store your ideas or feedback separately and review them after your next strategy meeting to be able to have an eye on the important items.

## Common Pitfalls

- You will often see items that are not ready to work on yet. Remove these items and take them (again) to your next grooming meeting.
- There may be ideas that do not fit the current product strategy. Don't forget to lower their priority or remove them from your backlog.
- When you have too many backlog items to work on, it becomes difficult to work with your backlog.
