# YAGNI Principle

**TL;DR**

YAGNI stands for 'You aren't gonna need it'. This principle states that only those functionalities which are necessary should be implemented.


## What Is YAGNI Principle

YAGNI is an extreme programming principle (XP) which states that you must not implement features that you think may be needed in the future. Only those functionalities should be implemented which are needed as per current requirements.

## Why You Might Want YAGNI Principle

This principle helps a you to focus on the required features and not add unnecessary functionality. As a programmer, you sometimes try to foresee the future of functionalities. You presume that additional requirements might come up in the future. There is an assumption that the present code should encapsulate this.
A lot of effort, time, and cost is involved in implementing new functionalities. Implementing additional functionalities can lead to schedule slippage, code complexity apart from unnecessary code. These features need to be maintained and may even need to be modified in the future. There are chances that the functionalities may become obsolete and may never be needed.


## Problems YAGNI Principle Helps to Solve

- [Increased Cost](/problems/increased-cost)
- [Meaningless Work](/problems/meaningless-work)
- [Poor code quality](/problems/poor-code-quality)
- [Unnecessary Features](/problems/unnecessary-features)


## How to Implement YAGNI Principle

**Clarity on requirements and deadlines**

You must have a clear picture of the requirements and targets to prevent deviations from the required design.

**Analysis**

Think if the extra features that will be needed sometime soon or are you assuming they may be a part of the distant future.

**Planning**

You should plan for the effort required and if it will be better to do it at present or leave it for later. This will also include the time to test and review the extra code. 


## Common Pitfalls

- Overenthusiasm for providing the best and lasting solutions leads to adding extra features.
- Coding habits of programmers make them think ahead of time and include  extra functionalities.
