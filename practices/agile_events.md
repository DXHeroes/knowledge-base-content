# Agile Events

## What Are Agile Events

Agile Events, formerly Agile Ceremonies, are a set of meetings prescribed for Agile frameworks. The most common Agile framework with such rituals is [Scrum](/practices/scrum). It is recommended for the Scrum framework to hold five key events during every Sprint to work efficiently. Those five events are:

- Daily Standup
- Sprint Planning
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective
- The Sprint

Let us explain what those events mean:

**Daily Standup**
- Also known as **Daily Scrum**.
- Usually a daily meeting, not more than 15 minutes.
- Typical for Scrum and Kanban Agile framework.
- Team members should describe what did they work on yesterday and what are they going to work on today. It should not be detailed.

**Sprint Planning**
- A sprint is a term specific for a Scrum framework. Other types of agile frameworks use “iteration” to define a time-boxed period of development.
- It is a meeting where the team decides what to do during the sprint. A sprint is usually a two-week period.
- The team has to estimate how much work they can complete from the product backlog and the effort involved.

**Iteration Review**
- At the end of a sprint or milestone, the team should review their accomplishments and get feedback from stakeholders.
- It is typical for Scrum and Kanban. Scrum uses the term **Sprint Review**.

**Retrospective**
- It is a feedback at the end of an iteration. The team gets to know what worked well and what could have been done better.
- Scrum and Kanban frameworks use this meeting for creating solutions and developing action plans.

**Product Backlog Refinement**
- Formerly **Backlog Grooming**. This term was officially replaced in 2013 due to negative connotations in British English.
- In this meeting, the team adds details and estimates the effort for each item from the Product Backlog. The Backlog is updated and the items are prepared for the upcoming sprint.
- It is an ongoing activity but the team can decide to time-box it.

**The Sprint**
- It is the time-boxed period that contains all the work and all the other events.

The rituals should be chosen wisely. For example, Waterfall methodology does not even operate with the term “daily standup”. It is necessary that the team understands what are the events for. They should be accepted as smoothly as possible. The team can validate the events retrospectively to see if they are really useful.

## Why You Might Want the Agile Events

Every project phase needs its own set of rituals. Those rituals help the team to work faster, more efficient, and closer together. They simplify the work and make the Product Backlog items clearer (a product backlog is simply a list of items that need to be done within the project).

Even though the events are here to help, developers struggle to find every single meeting useful. The most hated meetings are the daily standups because they sometimes seem like a waste of time even if they last just a few minutes. But to be fair, the daily standups are really important for sharing knowledge, finding problems sooner, measuring the progress and last but not least, building team unity.

## Issues the Agile Events Solve

- [Bad product-market fit](/issues/bad-product-market-fit)
- [Demotivated team](/issues/demotivated-team)
- Unsuccessful product
- Unhappy clients
- Disconnection with business
- ["Not My Problem" Mentality](issues/not-my-problem-mentality)

## How to Implement the Agile Events

- Events should be stable, the rituals should be followed regularly.
- The length of each meeting should be defined to achieve a positive mindset within the team.
- Events can be defined either by the team or by the team culture.
- Each Event has its own [roles](/practices/role_definition) that share responsibilities.
- Hire experienced professionals to handle Agile Events. The investment can be more beneficial than trying to implement Events in a team without any experience.

## Common Pitfalls of the Agile Events

- **Demotivated team**  
  The team is confused. They do not understand why they should do the rituals, the planning does not work.
- **Events are not fun**  
	Events are dehumanized, boring, the team members struggle to concentrate. Make the rituals fun! Be friendly, lightweight your language.
- **Micromanagement**  
	Everyday meetings can feel like an additional layer of micromanagement to a regular amount of work. Nobody likes micromanagement. Explain the benefits of periodic meetings to your team.
- **Focusing too much on standups**  
	Everyday standups are not always necessary. Focus on the team members’ feelings rather than on following Agile Events rules.
