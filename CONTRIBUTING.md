### Feeling and Grammar

- Use active voice whenever possible
- Establish a clear structure and try to be precise
- Be brief, clear, and direct
  - Important information in the main clause
- Simplify your language
  - Use fewer words and get to the point
- Avoid jargon and abbreviations
  - Define acronyms and initialism on their first use - give the abbreviation in parentheses after the full terminology
- Use a grammar check tool, for example:
  - [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com)

### Content Composition

**Repository Folders**

- There are 3 important folders in the root of the repository:
  - [**files**](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/files) - stores all the images and other files necessary for articles (problem/practice)
  - [**problems**](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/problems) - stores all DX problems
  - [**practices**](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/practices) - stores all DX practices

- Put your file to correct folder based on the type of your article ([problem](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/problems)/[practice](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/practices)). E.g. practice pull request [on the Knowledge Base](https://developerexperience.io/practices/pull-requests) and [in the repository](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/blob/master/practices/pull_requests.md)
